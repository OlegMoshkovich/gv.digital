      <p>Question...</p>
      <p>Do you know what was Al Capone's drink of choice?</p>
      <p>Templeton Rye Whiskey</p>
      <p>Bottom of the bottle looks like an ashtray</p>
      <p>because the bottle would be buried in the sand </p>
      <p>as Alcatraz guards would pass by.</p>
      <p>we would be delighted to tell you all we know </p>
      <p>...about Whiskey :) </p>
      <p>By the way...</p>
      <p>If kept closed,</p>
      <p>you can keep a bottle of scotch for 100 years!</p>
      <p>Once it’s open...it’s good for about five years.</p>
      <p>And since we are on the topic!</p>
      <p>The single malt that sells the most around the world</p>
      <p>...is Glenfiddich</p>
      <p>The four other bestsellers</p>
      <p>...are The Glenlivet, Glenmorangie Original, Laphroaig</p>
      <p>...and Aberlour</p>
      <p>When it comes to the best-selling scotch,</p>
      <p>Johnnie Walker Red Label takes the cake.</p>
      <p>The most expensive bottle of scotch whiskey in the world is ... </p>
<p>the Original Isabella’s Islay—it costs $6.2 million.</p>
<p>If you’re not down to spend millions...</p>
<p>you can get the Isabella Special Edition bottle for $740,000.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact!!!</p>
<p>If you buy a bottle of Laphroaig single malt whiskey,</p>
<p>you also get a lifetime lease for one square foot... </p>
<p>of their distillery...how about that!</p>
<p>And now few facts about Wine!</p>
<p>Do you know?</p>
<p>The word “sommelier” is a old French word meaning butler</p>
<p>or an officer in charge of provisions,</p>
<p>derived from the Old Provençal saumalier, or pack-animal driver.</p>
<p>Did you know that it takes three types of grapes to make Champagne? </p>
<p>It does!</p>
<p>It takes two reds, a Pinot Noir and a Pinot Meunier;</p>
<p>and one white, a Chardonnay.</p>
<p>The color of a Champagne comes from the pressing,</p>
<p>when winemakers decide how much of the grape skin’s pigments </p>
<p>...to color the wine.</p>
<p>Also, unsurprisingly...</p>
<p>China has become the leading market for red wine</p>
<p> not just for its flavor. But also for its color :)</p>
<p>Which is considered lucky!</p>
<p>Lets not forget about tequila!!!</p>
<p>Tequila is named after the city where it originated.</p>
<p> - the town called Tequila in Mexico’s Jalisco state</p>
<p>The liquor’s popularity has led the town </p>
<p>to become a World Heritage Site </p>
<p>and earned it the name “Pueblo Mágico,” or “Magical Town” </p>
<p>Patron is the “crappy” tequila in Mexico!</p>
<p>...here as well, if we might add</p>
<p>and ... Mexicans don’t take tequila shots, ever.</p>
<p>They mostly sip tequila straight</p>
<p>or mix it with club soda</p>
<p>maybe with a splash of grapefruit juice.</p>
<p>Cocktails are rare</p>
<p>people don’t really drink margaritas</p>
<p>...and they definitely don’t take tequila shots.</p>
